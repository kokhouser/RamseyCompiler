Note: Three test files are included in this folder (progresstest.ram, test.ram and testtwo.ram).
      These files are meant to be lexed and parsed correctly. However, there is code commented out that will break the parsing.
      Remove the comment symbols ("#") to test error reporting.


How to run lexer & parser:

1. Install something that runs php. a command line interface is recommended

2. Run the lexer, with the test filename after the lexer
	For example: "php lexer.php testtwo.ram"

   Note: This will create a "token.txt" in the current directory containing all the tokens generated by the lexer, to be used by the parser.

3. Run the parser, with the command: "php parser.php"

4. Note any errors reported, or the congratulation message if there were no errors detected.
